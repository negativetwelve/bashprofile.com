In Unix or any sort of Terminal interface the quickest way to navigate through folders is to use the <code>cd</code> command. You simply type <code>cd 'folder_name'</code> to "change directory" into the folder name. 

A simple shortcut to change into the directory one level up is to type in <code>cd ..</code>

In Unix, one dot "." resembles the current directory, while two dots ".." signifies one directory up.

To reiterate, if my folder structure was <code>~/folder/sample/structure/files</code> and I was in the "sample" folder, to get to the folder called "folder" I would simply just type <code>cd ..</code>. To get to the folder labeled "structure" I would type <code>cd structure</code>. It is that simple!
