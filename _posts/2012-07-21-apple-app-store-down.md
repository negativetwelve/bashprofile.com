Today, many people around the world could not connect to Apple's App Store. People had problems updating apps and purchasing new ones, the forums all over the internet went crazy. If you are having this issue right now, you can simply follow this simple fix: log out entirely from the App Store by going to Settings > Store > Clicking on your Apple ID at the bottom > Sign Out. Then, you can simply sign back in using the same process. Now, you should be able to download and purchase apps again!
